Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

1 None      2 abc       3 def
4 ghi       5 jkl       6 mno
7 pqrs      8 tuv       9 wxyz
* +         0           #

Example:

Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].
