Description:

Your task is to calculate ab mod 1337 where a is a positive integer and b is an extremely large positive integer given in the form of an array.

Example 1:

Input: a = 2, b = [3]
Output: 8



Example 2:

Input: a = 2, b = [1,0]
Output: 1024

# B : the length of input list, b
# n : the value of expoenent % 1140

## Time Complexity: O( n )
#
# The overhead in time is the times of multiplication, which is of O( n ),
# and the extraction of exponent, which is of O( B )

## Space Complexity: O( 1 )
#
# THe overhead in space is the storage for power, which is of O( 1 )
