Description:

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the i-th barcode is barcodes[i].

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal.  You may return any answer, and it is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]



Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 

Note:

1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000
1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000
