Description:

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exist different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.

A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.



Example 2:


Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
0 <= Node.val <= 105

Hint #1  
For each subtree, find the minimum value and maximum value of its descendants.
