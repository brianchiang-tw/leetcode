Description:

Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the range [low, high].

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32



Example 2:


Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
1 <= low <= high <= 105
All Node.val are unique.
