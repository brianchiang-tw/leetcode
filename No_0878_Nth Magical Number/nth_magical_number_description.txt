A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either A or B.

Return the N-th magical number.  Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 1, A = 2, B = 3
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: N = 4, A = 2, B = 3
Output: 6
Example 3:

Input: N = 5, A = 2, B = 4
Output: 10
Example 4:

Input: N = 3, A = 6, B = 4
Output: 8
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^9
2 <= A <= 40000
2 <= B <= 40000
