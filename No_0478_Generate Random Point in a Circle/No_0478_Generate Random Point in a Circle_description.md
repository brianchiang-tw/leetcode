Description:

Given the radius and x-y positions of the center of a circle, write a function randPoint which generates a uniform random point in the circle.

Note:

input and output values are in floating-point.
radius and x-y position of the center of the circle is passed into the class constructor.
a point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle.
randPoint returns a size 2 array containing x-position and y-position of the random point, in that order.



Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","randPoint","randPoint","randPoint"]
[[1,0,0],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,[-0.72939,-0.65505],[-0.78502,-0.28626],[-0.83119,-0.19803]]



Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","randPoint","randPoint","randPoint"]
[[10,5,-7.5],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,[11.52438,-8.33273],[2.46992,-16.21705],[11.13430,-12.42337]]
Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has three arguments, the radius, x-position of the center, and y-position of the center of the circle. randPoint has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
